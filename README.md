# The Japan COVID-19 Task Force (JCTF) whole blood RNA-seq analysis


Welcome to the github page for the [The whole blood transcriptional regulation landscape in 465 COVID-19 infected samples from Japan COVID-19 Task Force. Nat Commun nn, nnnn (2022). paper](link: to be added), where we report on a thorough analysis of whole blood RNA-seq data from 465 genotyped samples from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force, including 359 severe and 106 non-severe COVID-19 cases.

The scripts used in the paper are stored in the code directory.

A tutorial exploring the summary data from our analysis can be found at `jctf_rna_tutorial.ipynb`. 
The data analysed in the notebook is publicly available at the [NBDC Human Database (ID: hum0343.v2)](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/hum0343-v2).
